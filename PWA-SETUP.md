# PWA Setup Instructions

## Current Status

✅ Manifest file configured
✅ Service Worker created
✅ Service Worker registration added
⚠️ Need proper icon files

## To Make It a Full PWA:

### 1. Create Icon Files

You need actual PNG images (not SVG). Create or download 192x192 and 512x512 pixel PNG images and place them in `public/`:

- `public/pwa-192x192.png`
- `public/pwa-512x512.png`

**Easy way:** Use an online tool like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

Or just use any 🎸 guitar emoji/icon image and resize it.

### 2. Build and Test

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open in your browser and check:
- Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest (should show no errors)
- Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers (should be registered)
- You should see an "Install App" button in the address bar

### 3. Mobile Testing

Deploy to a server with HTTPS (required for PWA):
- Netlify (free): just drag & drop the `dist/` folder
- Vercel (free): `npx vercel`
- GitHub Pages

Then open on your phone:
- **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Install App

## Features You Get

✅ **Installable** - Adds to home screen like a native app
✅ **Offline-capable** - Works without internet (basic caching)
✅ **Standalone mode** - No browser UI, looks like native app
✅ **Fast loading** - Cached resources load instantly

## What's Missing vs Full PWA Plugin?

The manual setup provides basic PWA. For advanced features, you'd need vite-plugin-pwa:
- Advanced caching strategies
- Background sync
- Push notifications
- Automatic cache management

But for your use case (local-only guitar tracker), the manual setup is perfect!
